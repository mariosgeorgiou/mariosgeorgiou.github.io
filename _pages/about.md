I'm Marios and I am a Software Engineer and Researcher at [Galois](https://galois.com/).
I received my PhD on Cryptography from the [Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu) of the City University of New York. I was very grateful to have [Nelly Fazio](http://www-cs.ccny.cuny.edu/~fazio/)  as my advisor. Before joining CUNY, I received my [Master in Computer Science](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php) from Paris 7 Diderot under the supervision of [Iordanis Kerenidis](https://www.irif.fr/~jkeren/jkeren/Iordanis_Kerenidis.html). Before that, I studied [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at the National Technical University of Athens and was a member of [CoReLab](http://corelab.ntua.gr/).

<!-- Blockchain-less Cryptocurrency?
======
Can we build a decentralized cryptocurrency without a blockchain and need for active consensus, where new coins are mined using proof of work and transactions happen almost instantly using only classical communication? Most likely yes! [This](https://medium.com/@mgeorgiou.ece/a-secure-and-decentralized-cryptocurrency-without-a-blockchain-182ccb9170a6) 2-minute article summarizes how. -->
